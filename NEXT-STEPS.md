## ðŸš€ When You're Ready to Launch

### Pre-Launch Checklist

**1. Create Demo Assets** (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Record 2-3 min demo video showing:
  - Tenant sends "toilet overflowing" text
  - FlowBridge receives and analyzes with AI
  - WhatsApp alert sent to owner
  - Google Sheets updated
  - Emphasize: "Runs locally, $0 AI costs"
- [ ] Take screenshots:
  - Dashboard (or mockup)
  - Google Sheets with logs
  - WhatsApp alert example
  - AI analysis output

**2. Create Good First Issues** (30 mins)
- [ ] Tag 3-5 easy issues on GitHub:
  - "Add Slack integration"
  - "Improve error messages"
  - "Add Spanish translation"
  - "Create Docker container"
  - "Add sentiment analysis visualization"

**3. Test Quick Start** (15 mins)
- [ ] Have someone (or yourself on fresh VM) try setup
- [ ] Verify it works in <15 minutes
- [ ] Fix any friction points

### Launch Day Strategy

**Morning (8-10am EST - Best Time for HN/Reddit)**

**1. Hacker News** (Post first - most time-sensitive)
```
Title: Show HN: FlowBridge â€“ Property management automation with local AI (Ollama)

I built FlowBridge to solve drowning in 200+ tenant messages/week across SMS, email, and WhatsApp.

Key features:
- Webhook-based ingestion (OpenPhone, Gmail, WhatsApp)
- Local AI classification via Ollama (Llama 3.1)
- Emergency detection with instant WhatsApp alerts
- Automatic Google Sheets logging
- AI-generated daily reports

The interesting part: All AI runs locally via Ollama (no cloud APIs).
Uses 8B model for fast (<2s) classification, 70B for quality reports.
Total AI cost: $0/month (just electricity).

Built with Node.js + Express. MIT licensed.

Would love feedback on the architecture!
```

**2. Reddit** (Post to 5 subreddits, space 30min apart)

**r/PropertyManagement**
```
Title: "Built a free tool that saves me 10+ hours/week on tenant communications"

I manage 50 rental units and was drowning in messages across SMS, email, and WhatsApp.
Manually logging everything and writing reports was taking 10+ hours per week.
I nearly missed a plumbing emergency because it got buried.

Built FlowBridge to solve this:
- Listens to all channels via webhooks
- Uses local AI (Ollama) to categorize messages
- Detects emergencies and alerts via WhatsApp instantly
- Logs everything to Google Sheets automatically
- Generates AI-written daily reports

Best part: AI runs completely locally. Zero cloud costs. Zero data leaving my control.
Been running 2 months, processed 1,200+ messages, saved ~40 hours.

Made it open-source: https://github.com/shafenkhan/flowbridge

Happy to answer questions!
```

**Other subreddits** (adjust tone slightly for each):
- r/landlord - Focus on emergency detection
- r/selfhosted - Focus on local AI/privacy
- r/LocalLLaMA - Focus on Ollama integration
- r/opensource - Focus on MIT license/community

**3. Twitter/X**
```
ðŸŒ‰ Just open-sourced FlowBridge!

A property management automation tool that:
â€¢ Uses local AI (Ollama) for $0/month costs
â€¢ Detects emergencies in tenant messages
â€¢ Auto-logs to Google Sheets
â€¢ Generates daily reports

Built it after drowning in 200+ messages/week.
